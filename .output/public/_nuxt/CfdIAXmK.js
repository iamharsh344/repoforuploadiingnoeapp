You begin with a small space, a basic stove, and just a few tables. But do not worry, because every pro player once stood exactly where you are right now. This guide will show you how to grow step by step until you reach the throne as a Restaurant King. By the end you will have learned how to serve faster, earn millions, and unlock features that make your restaurant an empire. </p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-yellow-300">🚀 Building Your First Setup</h2><p class="text-purple-100 mb-4"> When you first enter the game your main goal is to start serving quickly. Place your tables and chairs in a way that makes walking paths clear. Customers in Roblox games can get stuck easily, so avoid blocking spaces with furniture. Focus on keeping everything simple and functional. At this stage you do not need decorations because they do not improve your income. Spend every coin on items that increase your efficiency. </p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3 text-yellow-300">💼 Staff Upgrades are the Real Power</h2><p class="text-purple-100 mb-4"> Your chefs and waiters are the real heroes of your business. The faster they work the more money you earn. Upgrade your waiters so that tables are cleared quickly. Upgrade your chefs so that food gets served without delay. And remember that dishwashers play a huge role because dirty plates can slow down your service. Once your staff is working at high speed you will notice that your cash begins to grow consistently. </p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3 text-yellow-300">🏆 Expanding Floors with Strategy</h2><p class="text-purple-100 mb-4"> After you begin making steady money you can start expanding to higher floors. Every new floor gives you more space to serve more customers. But instead of just filling the space randomly, use smart layouts. Many advanced players design compact table and chair setups close to stoves. This keeps staff movement short and allows them to serve faster. More customers served in less time means more cash in your bank. </p>',8)),o(l),e[2]||(e[2]=n('<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3 text-yellow-300">👑 The Prestige System</h2><p class="text-purple-100 mb-4"> Once you reach the point where your restaurant is full and you feel like progress is slowing down, it is time to use Prestige. Prestiging resets your progress but rewards you with multipliers, rare furniture, and bragging rights. Think of it as a new chapter where you get stronger every time. The earlier you begin prestiging, the faster your journey to the top will be in the long run. Many top players use Prestige multiple times to gain huge advantages over others. </p><div class="flex justify-center mb-5"><img class="w-96 rounded-xl shadow-lg" alt="mr" src="'+v+'"></div><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3 text-yellow-300">💡 Pro Tips from Veteran Players</h2><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-purple-100"><li>Use vending machines for extra cash even when you are AFK</li><li>Place chairs and tables close to stoves so staff works faster</li><li>Limited event furniture can give bonuses that last forever</li></ul><p class="text-purple-100 mt-6"> Becoming a Restaurant King does not happen overnight, but every small upgrade pushes you closer to the throne. Keep improving your staff, expand smartly, and use Prestige wisely. With patience you will turn your tiny diner into a massive empire that serves thousands of happy customers while you watch the cash flow in. That is the true power of My Restaurant. </p>',6)),t("div",M,[o(s,{to:"/myrestaurant/",class:"inline-block bg-yellow-400 hover:bg-yellow-500 text-purple-900 font-semibold py-3 px-6 rounded-xl shadow-md transition"},{default:a(()=>e[0]||(e[0]=[r(" View MR Values ")])),_:1,__:[0]})])]),t("section",T,[e[12]||(e[12]=t("h2",{class:"text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-center"},"🔗 Related Guides",-1)),t("div",C,[t("div",P,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("h3",{class:"text-lg font-semibold"},"🚀 Every Update Ranked",-1)),e[5]||(e[5]=t("p",{class:"text-sm text-purple-200 mt-2"},"We rate all My Restaurant updates from the earliest to the latest and reveal which ones are legendary.",-1)),o(s,{to:"/myrestaurantvalues/Every-Update-Ranked-Which-My-Restaurant-Event-Was-the-GOAT",class:"text-yellow-300 font-medium mt-3 inline-block"},{default:a(()=>e[3]||(e[3]=[r("Read More →")])),_:1,__:[3]})]),t("div",F,[e[7]||(e[7]=t("h3",{class:"text-lg font-semibold"},"💸 Insane Layouts That Print Cash And How to Copy Them",-1)),e[8]||(e[8]=t("p",{class:"text-sm text-purple-200 mt-2"},"Discover the best money-making layouts in Roblox My Restaurant and.",-1)),o(s,{to:"/myrestaurantvalues/Insane-Layouts-That-Print-Cash-And-How-to-Copy-Them",class:"text-yellow-300 font-medium mt-3 inline-block"},{default:a(()=>e[6]||(e[6]=[r("Read More →")])),_:1,__:[6]})]),t("div",A,[e[10]||(e[10]=t("h3",{class:"text-lg font-semibold"},"🐾 How to Get Rare Pets in Grow a Garden",-1)),e[11]||(e[11]=t("p",{class:"text-sm text-purple-200 mt-2"},"A complete guide to hatching, finding, and boosting your odds...",-1)),o(s,{to:"/growagarden/How-to-Get-Rare-Pets-in-Grow-a-Garden",class:"text-yellow-300 font-medium mt-3 inline-block"},{default:a(()=>e[9]||(e[9]=[r("Read More →")])),_:1,__:[9]})])])])]),o(u)],64)}const I=g(_,[["render",K]]);export{I as default};
