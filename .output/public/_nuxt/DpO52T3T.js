One of the coolest features of the game is the <strong>Live Stock System</strong>, which lets players check what items (like <em>eggs, seeds, vegetables, and more</em>) are currently available. This system makes the game feel alive and connected, because stock isn’t always unlimited it updates in real-time as players harvest and interact with the world. </p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-yellow-300">🥚 Eggs &amp; Farm Animals</h2><p class="text-purple-100 mb-4"> Players can collect <strong>eggs</strong> from chickens, ducks, and other farm animals. These eggs are part of the live stock system and may run out if too many players buy them at once. This adds a fun challenge should you grab eggs now, or wait for the next stock refresh? </p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3 text-yellow-300">🌾 Seeds &amp; Gardening Items</h2><p class="text-purple-100 mb-4"> Seeds are the heart of <em>Grow a Garden</em>. The live stock board shows exactly which seeds are in stock from common wheat and carrots to rare plants that only appear at certain times. Keeping track of stock lets you plan your farming strategy and grow the most profitable crops. </p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3 text-yellow-300">🍅 Why the Live Stock System Matters</h2><p class="text-purple-100 mb-4"> Unlike many Roblox farming games where items are always available, <strong>Grow a Garden</strong> adds realism by introducing limited availability. This makes farming more competitive, encourages trading with other players, and creates a real sense of economy inside the game. Players who watch the stock closely often gain a huge advantage. </p>',8)),s(i),e[2]||(e[2]=t("h2",{class:"text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3 text-yellow-300"},"👀 Final Thoughts",-1)),e[3]||(e[3]=t("p",{class:"text-purple-100 mb-4"},[o(" The live stock system is what makes "),t("strong",null,"Grow a Garden"),o(" stand out.
